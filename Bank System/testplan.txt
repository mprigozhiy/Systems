When testing our code, the overall functionality works very well in our program. “open [username]” correctly opens a new account, “start [username]” correctly starts an account session, “credit [amount]” correctly adds funds from a specific user account, “debit [amount]” correctly removes funds from a specific user account and “balance” correctly prints the current balance for a user, “finish” closes the session and “exit” properly disconnects the client from the server. We implemented shared memory with multiprogramming and it works great and saves all bank accounts even when the server is shut down and not running. The bank server prints these accounts and their respective balances every 20 seconds as well! Overall, testing went very well.
